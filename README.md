# Skripts
These Are Project Skripts That I worked on

Since a lot of the code I currently used has either been replaced with Java or Lua. I decided to give away my skripts since their are people are aren't experience enough to use skripts. Development on the skripts will continue (but as the skripts progress, the more and more their updates won't change). 

But if you wanna contribute to the skript, here is my discord: https://discord.gg/nFqCjgn
